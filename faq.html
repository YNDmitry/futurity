          <div class="fq-h">Where does Futurity Manufacturing come from? What does it do?</div>
          <div class="q-p">Futurity Manufacturing was founded in New Zealand in 2017 and is proudly New Zealand owned and operated. Our facility processes advanced biomaterials into plastics components for a variety of industries and sectors. We are product designers and engineers, with the manufacturing capability to create more environmentally friendly products for businesses and consumers to use. Although we have in-house capability, we collaborate with local and global partners to continue evolving and deliver leading innovation.</div>

          <div class="q-p">Futurity Manufacturing uses bio materials derived from sustainable sources. The bio materials industry is constantly evolving with innovations being made to make these materials perform better while reducing impact on the environment. Where Futurity Manufacturing has chosen to use a certain material to launch a product, it’s part of our ethos to change this if a better material becomes available.</div>

          <div class="fq-h">What does being Carbon Neutral mean?</div>
          <div class="q-p">Being carbon neutral refers to achieving net zero carbon dioxide emissions. This can be achieved by offsetting the amount of carbon emissions produced by a company through the purchase of carbon credits. This results in taking carbon out of the atmosphere through carbon sequestration or simply eliminating carbon emissions altogether. As a company, we recognise that simply by making products, we will always have some impact on the environment.  <br><br>That’s why we have committed to measure and offset our emissions from our products through the purchasing of carbon credits from EKOS to regenerate permanent indigenous forests in New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.</div>

          <div class="fq-h">What is the end-of-life issue for products?</div>
          <div class="q-p">This refers to the issue of how a product is processed when the consumer is finished with it. The end-of-life issue surrounds the process of retaining the most material value of a product, while having the least environmental impacts.  In New Zealand, there are issues around ensuring the intended end-of-life is actually able to be achieved given the limited capacity for commercial composting.</div>

          <div class="fq-h">What does commercially compostable mean?</div>
          <div class="q-p">Composting is the natural, biological decomposition of organic matter by fungi, bacteria, insects, worms and other organisms. Organisms that decompose organic matter require basic inputs and conditions like water, heat and oxygen. There are a number of different ways to make compost. Home composting is different from commercial composting. <br><br>Commercial composting is defined by tightly controlled facilities operating at much higher temperatures then the average home compost system. In New Zealand, commercial composters generally use windrow, vermicomposting or in-vessel methods. The compostable items that go into an industrial composting system are called feedstock. At this stage, our products are only able to be processed in commercial compost facilities that accept our product. <br><br>Our products are not home compostable.</div>

          <div class="fq-h">How does commercial composting work in New Zealand? Do we have the appropriate infrastructure?</div>
          <div class="q-p">Commercial composting is currently limited in New Zealand, with only certain operators accepting commercially compostable packaging. There is no widespread, national solution, and therefore it is critical that every commercially compostable product has a place to go for it’s end-of-life in order to to make the claim that it is deemed commercially compostable.  <br><br>Futurity Manufacturing&#x27;s products work in closed loop environments where we are able to ensure it is sent to a commercial compost facility. If this isn’t possible with a client, we will liaise and find a solution. When Futurity Manufacturing onboard clients, we agree on the collection and end-of-life, and communicate this accordingly so that consumers know how to dispose of them.<br><br>Currently, this issue is being dealt with by a number of organisations who are working towards solving the growing concern for the necessary commercial composting infrastructure in New Zealand.</div>

        <div>What is chemical recycling and what is Futurity Manufacturing&#x27;s stance on it?</div>
      </div>

          <div class="fq-h">What is chemical recycling and what is Futurity Manufacturing&#x27;s stance on it?</div>
          <div class="q-p">Chemical recycling is the next generation of recycling and can be achieved through a number of different processes. <br><br>The process traditionally involves mechanically cutting up the material being recycled to create a new product. This process cuts the chains of polymers which degrade the material so that the recycled plastic is lesser in quality. From here these degraded materials will often need to be mixed with virgin materials to provide enough strength for the new material to be used again in new products. This is where you will often see products made up of a percentage of recycled materials. <br><br>Chemical recycling is different as this breaks down the materials without breaking the polymers and therefore this can be reused without degradation because new bonds are recreated, therefore creating ‘as new’ plastics again, and again. Chemical recycling has the potential to purify the polymers by removing identified or unidentified additives, unachievable by mechanical recycling via separation through different stages of the process. <br><br>Futurity Manufacturing believes Chemical Recycling is the future of recycling, as it means that maximum material value is retained throughout the process. We have invested in research with Scion to prove the ability of our products to be chemically recycling, in anticipation of this technology becoming feasible in the near future.</div>
